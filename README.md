# Kaggle Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview
This repository hosts the Kaggle Breast Cancer Detection project, focusing on predictive modeling for diagnosing breast cancer. The project revolves around leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately predict the presence of breast cancer using diagnostic measurements.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Description**: The Breast Cancer Dataset comprises detailed medical data crucial for predictive modeling in breast cancer diagnosis. It includes a wide range of features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
- **Attributes**: The dataset contains 569 rows and 32 attributes, including diagnostic measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
- **Label Type**: 'diagnosis' (M = malignant, B = benign)
- **Missing Values**: None

## Challenges
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset exhibits class imbalance, with a majority of samples belonging to the 'B' (benign) class.
- **Data Sensitivity**: Addressing privacy concerns and handling the sensitivity associated with medical diagnostic data.
- **Feature Selection**: The dataset contains a large number of diverse diagnostic measurements, necessitating feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most impactful features.
- **Limited Samples**: Due to the limited number of data points, building robust predictive models poses challenges such as overfitting.
